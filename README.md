# gopus152

Go bindings for Opus Codec version 1.5.2 (Apr 12, 2024) used with x86_64 talKKonnect clients.

# gopus

[gopus](https://github.com/layeh/gopus) is a [Go](https://go.dev/) binding for the [Opus](https://opus-codec.org) audio codec. It was originally created by [Tim Cooper](https://github.com/layeh), author of [Gumble](https://github.com/layeh/gumble), a [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info) client implementation in Go. Gumble had gained a great popularity with the launch of [talkiepi](https://github.com/dchote/talkiepi) project by [Daniel Chote](https://github.com/dchote) creating an innovative headless Mumble intercom for [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com). Soon after, another popular project influenced by Gumble and talkiepi was born. It was [talKKonnect](https://github.com/talkkonnect/talkkonnect) by [Suvir Kumar](https://github.com/talkkonnect). talKKonnect project drove the concept of headless Mumble intercoms for single board computers to a whole new level. During the development of talKKonnect, it was useful to run and test talKKonnect's on x86_64 systems in addition to ARM from single board computers.

When building Gumble-like clients and its popular forks, talkiepi and talKKonnect on ARM platforms, shared OPUS library headers and development files from Linux `libopus-dev` package are used. However, when building Gumble-like clients in x86_64 platforms, static libraries are used. During the build, Golang `cgo` tool is used to process a large number of include statements. File of a highly critical importance for successful building in x86_64 is `config.h`, a header library for parsing configuration options to the C compiler. This file is usually created automatically with `autoconf` and `configure` script. However, with `config.h` produced automatically, building is not always guaranteed to work and the header file options, need to be carefully reviewed for anything that could break the build.

In this repo, we shall try to watch gopus behavior with x86_64 builds of talKKonnect and keep it up to date with the latest Opus libraries. Gopus with Gumble, originally integrated Opus version 1.1.2 libraries back in 2016. Gopus was later updated in 2022 in talKKonnect to work with Opus version 1.3.1. A current version of Opus is 1.5.2. This gopus repository will be updated from time to time, to support latest Opus libraries, starting with version 1.5.2, to ensure talKKonnectâ€™s can build and run on majority of x86_64 systems.
